[heading Version 3.1.0 - boost 1.52]

Deprecated Features:

Deprecated features since boost 1.50 available only until boost 1.55:

These deprecated features will be provided by default up to boost 1.52. If you don't want to include the deprecated features you could define BOOST_THREAD_DONT_PROVIDE_DEPRECATED_FEATURES_SINCE_V3_0_0. Since 1.53 these features will not be included any more by default. Since this version, if you want to include the deprecated features yet you could define BOOST_THREAD_PROVIDE_DEPRECATED_FEATURES_SINCE_V3_0_0. These deprecated features will be only available until boost 1.55, that is you have yet 1 year to move to the new features.

* Time related functions don't using the Boost.Chrono library, use the chrono overloads instead.

Breaking changes when BOOST_THREAD_VERSION==3 (Default value since Boost 1.53):

There are some new features which share the same interface but with different behavior. These breaking features are provided by default when BOOST_THREAD_VERSION is 3, but the user can however choose the version 2 behavior by defining the corresponding macro. As for the deprecated features, these broken features will be only available until boost 1.55.

[heading Version 2.1.0 - Changes since boost 1.40]

The 1.41.0 release of Boost adds futures to the thread library. There are also a few minor changes.

[heading Changes since boost 1.35]

The 1.36.0 release of Boost includes a few new features in the thread library:

* New generic __lock_multiple_ref__ and __try_lock_multiple_ref__ functions for locking multiple mutexes at once.

* Rvalue reference support for move semantics where the compilers supports it.

* A few bugs fixed and missing functions added (including the serious win32 condition variable bug).

* `scoped_try_lock` types are now backwards-compatible with Boost 1.34.0 and previous releases.

* Support for passing function arguments to the thread function by supplying additional arguments to the __thread__ constructor.

* Backwards-compatibility overloads added for `timed_lock` and `timed_wait` functions to allow use of `xtime` for timeouts.

[heading Version 2.0.0 - Changes since boost 1.34]

Almost every line of code in __boost_thread__ has been changed since the 1.34 release of boost. However, most of the interface
changes have been extensions, so the new code is largely backwards-compatible with the old code. The new features and breaking
changes are described below.

[heading New Features]

* Instances of __thread__ and of the various lock types are now movable.

* Threads can be interrupted at __interruption_points__.

* Condition variables can now be used with any type that implements the __lockable_concept__, through the use of
`boost::condition_variable_any` (`boost::condition` is a `typedef` to `boost::condition_variable_any`, provided for backwards
compatibility). `boost::condition_variable` is provided as an optimization, and will only work with
`boost::unique_lock<boost::mutex>` (`boost::mutex::scoped_lock`).

* Thread IDs are separated from __thread__, so a thread can obtain it's own ID (using `boost::this_thread::get_id()`), and IDs can
be used as keys in associative containers, as they have the full set of comparison operators.

* Timeouts are now implemented using the Boost DateTime library, through a typedef `boost::system_time` for absolute timeouts, and
with support for relative timeouts in many cases. `boost::xtime` is supported for backwards compatibility only.

* Locks are implemented as publicly accessible templates `boost::lock_guard`, `boost::unique_lock`, `boost::shared_lock`, and
`boost::upgrade_lock`, which are templated on the type of the mutex. The __lockable_concept__ has been extended to include publicly
available __lock_ref__ and __unlock_ref__ member functions, which are used by the lock types.

[heading Breaking Changes]

The list below should cover all changes to the public interface which break backwards compatibility.

* __try_mutex__ has been removed, and the functionality subsumed into __mutex__. __try_mutex__ is left as a `typedef`,
but is no longer a separate class.

* __recursive_try_mutex__ has been removed, and the functionality subsumed into
__recursive_mutex__. __recursive_try_mutex__ is left as a `typedef`, but is no longer a separate class.

* `boost::detail::thread::lock_ops` has been removed. Code that relies on the `lock_ops` implementation detail will no longer work,
as this has been removed, as it is no longer necessary now that mutex types now have public __lock_ref__ and __unlock_ref__ member
functions.

* `scoped_lock` constructors with a second parameter of type `bool` are no longer provided. With previous boost releases,
``boost::mutex::scoped_lock some_lock(some_mutex,false);`` could be used to create a lock object that was associated with a mutex,
but did not lock it on construction. This facility has now been replaced with the constructor that takes a
`boost::defer_lock_type` as the second parameter: ``boost::mutex::scoped_lock some_lock(some_mutex,boost::defer_lock);``

* The `locked()` member function of the `scoped_lock` types has been renamed to __owns_lock_ref__.

* You can no longer obtain a __thread__ instance representing the current thread: a default-constructed __thread__ object is not
associated with any thread. The only use for such a thread object was to support the comparison operators: this functionality has
been moved to __thread_id__.

* The broken `boost::read_write_mutex` has been replaced with __shared_mutex__.

* __mutex__ is now never recursive. For Boost releases prior to 1.35 __mutex__ was recursive on Windows and not on POSIX platforms.

* When using a __recursive_mutex__ with a call to [cond_any_wait_link `boost::condition_variable_any::wait()`], the mutex is only
  unlocked one level, and not completely. This prior behaviour was not guaranteed and did not feature in the tests.

[endsect]

[section:future Future]

The following features will be included in next releases. 

# Complete the C++11 missing features, in particular

  * async with deferred and variadic rvalue reference args. 
  * [@http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6227 #6227] Use of variadic templates on Generic Locking Algorithms on compilers providing them. 
  * [@http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6270 #6270] Add thread constructor from movable callable and movable arguments following C++11.

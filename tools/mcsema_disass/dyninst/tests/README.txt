One test in run_tests.py (x86_lodsb) is not compilable on my machine.

Some additional tests over bigger programs were added each with its own running script.
exec_tests.sh runs all test available, takes build directory (.../remill-build/tools/mcsema/) as only argument (it should be easily modifiable).
